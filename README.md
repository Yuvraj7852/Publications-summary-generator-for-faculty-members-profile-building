# 📘 Phase I — Planning, Requirement Analysis & OOAD (Weeks 1–3)

This phase focuses on project initiation, requirement analysis, functional modeling, and object-oriented design for the **Publications Summary Generator for Faculty Profile Building** system.  
The goal was to clearly define the problem scope, set up development infrastructure, and prepare UML design artifacts before implementation.

---

## 🗓️ Week 1 — Project Initiation & Problem Analysis

- Studied the manual faculty publication profile process and identified automation needs  
- Finalized project problem statement, scope, and expected outcomes  
- Prepared Project Vision and initial planning notes  
- Identified core domain entities: Faculty, Publication, Summary  
- Defined high-level system modules (user interaction, publication handling, summary generation)  
- Set up GitHub repository and project structure  
- Configured Jira board and sprint workflow  
- Created and organized initial product backlog  
- Sprint 1 started — status on track

## 🗓️ Week 2 — Functional Modeling & Requirements Structuring

- Identified system actors (Faculty, Admin)  
- Derived primary and supporting use cases  
- Converted functional requirements into structured use cases  
- Prepared detailed Use Case descriptions (main & alternate flows)  
- Mapped use cases to Jira user stories for traceability  
- Defined system boundary and interaction flows  
- Validated requirements with sprint goals  
- Strengthened requirement coverage before design stage

## 🗓️ Week 3 — OOAD & UML Design Modeling

- Applied object-oriented analysis to domain model  
- Designed UML Class Diagram with OOPS principles  
- Used encapsulation and inheritance (User → Faculty/Admin)  
- Added service layer concepts (AI Service, Auth Service)  
- Created Sequence Diagram for AI paper evaluation flow  
- Created Activity Diagram for login → upload → report generation flow  
- Revised Class Diagram with AI Evaluation & Summary modules  
- Built UI prototype screens (Login, Dashboard, Upload, Results, Admin Panel)
